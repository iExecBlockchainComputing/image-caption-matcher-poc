# Image Description Matcher
This Decentralized application (dApp), performs a check whether the uploaded image matches a provided image description by the image uploader, 
to verify whether this description is accurate or not. 
The current dApp uses the BLIP model, provided by huggingface (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/blip)
Further, the dApp leverages Confidential Computing, in order to confidentially perform the computation on the uploaded image, which should remain private. 
This dApp can incentivize image uploaders to provide an accurate image description, to obtain a high similarity score.
